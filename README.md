# Google-Web-Scrapping
Scrapping of google top results of particular keywordds using beautifulsoup


Google does not allow scrapping through google results.
If done then it will block after some requests.

So, i have taken a website page and analyzed through based on required keyword and the top results.

# googlescrap.py contains scrapping through google results
# googlescrap2.py contains scrapping through top websites given by google based on particular keywords
